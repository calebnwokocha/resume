Your verification algorithm does not check whether the certificate is a valid certificate for the problem instance


[2024-10-08 9:43 AM] jjanzenn
To check that the last number that is printed is 2^k and that it is a valid certificate, you need to check each k, k+1, ..., 2^k is also printed

[2024-10-08 9:56 AM] calebnwokocha
@jacob "first year" janzen The claim that the algorithm is not in NP or P and that the verification algorithm does not check whether the certificate is valid for the problem instance is incorrect. 

Problem Definition: In the context of NP, a problem is classified in NP if its solution (or certificate) can be verified in polynomial time. The task here is to count from k to 2^k, and the certificate is the output sequence where the last value must be 2^k.

Verification Step: The verification algorithm checks if the last printed value is 2^k. This check is sufficient because the algorithm is deterministic: if the last value is correct and the counting logic is correct, all intermediate values k, k+1, ..., 2^k are guaranteed to have been printed. There's no need to verify each intermediate value separately because the counting process itself ensures their correctness.

Complexity Class: The verification step, which compares the last printed value to 2^k, runs in constant time O(1), placing this problem in NP. The counting process, although exponential, does not disqualify the problem from NP, as NP problems can have exponential complexity but still be verifiable in polynomial time.

Thus, the problem is indeed in NP, and the verification algorithm correctly checks the validity of the certificate.


[2024-10-08 9:58 AM] jjanzenn
I mean go off and collect your millenium prize or whatever, but I can assure you no journal will accept your proof because it is incorrect. You do not have a valid verification algorithm and the problem is *not* in NP

I think you're confusing solving time vs. verification time


[2024-10-08 10:17 AM] _swigg
sure the last check is a constant O(1) expression, but NP means it is *solvable* in polynomial time, not that the solution can be verified in polynomial time

It is true that ChatGPT can produce incorrect result sometimes, but I did not use ChatGPT to discover the algorithm (ECVA), I just used ChatGPT to describe ECVA. I would like to see the complete conversation of https://discord.com/channels/724363919035990106/785653516965380146/1288972132071637117 to find where the error started.

With your verification algorithm, there can be NO-instances with a certificate that would make it return YES


[2024-10-08 10:28 AM] jjanzenn
For instance, suppose you have k=4 and the program just prints out "16" and your certificate, which is just the last value printed out, is "16". This is the last value that was printed out, but this is still not a YES-instance of the problem; the program never printed out 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15


[2024-10-08 10:30 AM] jjanzenn
and furthermore, this problem is still not computable by a nondeterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. There is a hard lower bound of 2^k-k operations no matter which model of computation you use


[2024-10-08 10:32 AM] jjanzenn
I appreciate that you want to find something interesting, but this is just not good research. I encourage you to gain a deeper understanding of computational complexity theory before you try to prove results like this


[2024-10-08 10:35 AM] calebnwokocha
The verification algorithm checks if the last printed value is 2^k. This check is sufficient because the algorithm is deterministic: if the last value is correct and the counting logic is correct, all intermediate values k, k+1, ..., 2^k are guaranteed to have been printed. There's no need to verify each intermediate value separately because the counting process itself ensures their correctness.


[2024-10-08 10:37 AM] jjanzenn
The verification algorithm **must** account for malicious inputs, else it does not hold. My counter-example here https://discord.com/channels/724363919035990106/785653516965380146/1293233510529892414 does return YES on your verification algorithm and is not a YES-instance. Therefore, your verification algorithm does not work.


[2024-10-08 10:40 AM] jjanzenn
The key thing is that if x is a NO-instance, then Vfr(x,S) outputs 0 for every S, including values for S that are the same as certificates for a YES-instance


[2024-10-08 11:01 AM] calebnwokocha
@jacob "first year" janzen The claim that the verification algorithm would mistakenly return "YES" on malicious inputs misunderstands the nature of the counting process and certificate validation:

**Deterministic Nature of ECVA**: ECVA deterministically counts from k to 2^k, meaning it **cannot** skip intermediate values. For any valid input k, the process outputs every integer in the range k to 2^k. Therefore, if the last printed value is 2^k, it implies all preceding values were printed.

**No Ambiguity for YES/NO Instances**: If the input k is valid and ECVA correctly outputs 2^k, this output implicitly verifies that every value from k to 2^k has been printed. The verification checks the end condition and does not require examining intermediate values separately since the sequence is deterministic and sequential.

**Malicious Input Handling**: Malicious inputs that attempt to skip values would not succeed in this case because ECVA inherently processes every value in the defined range. The verification step only needs to check if the last value is 2^k, and since ECVA cannot produce a false certificate (i.e., it can't reach 2^k without printing all preceding values), any "malicious input" scenario is irrelevant.

Thus, ECVA structure ensures that any valid certificate correctly represents a YES-instance, and malicious inputs cannot bypass this verification process.


[2024-10-08 11:08 AM] jjanzenn
You do not understand how verification algorithms work for proving NP. You repeatedly state the same things that have clearly been copy-pasted from ChatGPT without using critical thinking to evaluate what you are sending. Your "proof" is blatantly incorrect and I don't know how to convince you further. Go waste your time and money on getting this published. No reputable journal will publish it and peer reviewers will give you exactly the same feedback that I have. *You* misunderstand "the nature" of "certificate validation". Yes the algorithm for ECVA is deterministic. That says nothing about whether an input to your verification algorithm used a correct algorithm for ECVA.

[2024-10-08 11:57 AM] jjanzenn
<C> is an efficient binary encoding of the certificate, |<C>| is the size of the binary encoding of the certificate. x is the input and |x| is the size of the input.


[2024-10-08 12:27 PM] mythic7777
One other fact is that the verification that you mention in the second step is no longer a polynomial time verification. As such, your certificate does not hold and hence the problem is not in NP.


[2024-10-08 12:31 PM] mythic7777
And again, echoing what Jacob already said. ChatGPT is very good at masking a wrong answer and making it appear as though if it were right; especially for computational complexity problems. And when you’re just starting out and don’t know much, you will not be able to parse through where and why the output generated by ChatGPT is wrong.


[2024-10-08 12:32 PM] mythic7777
I implore you to first critically think, solve, and understand the problem. This will be far more beneficial than copying any AI model’s output for a temporary satisfactory answer.

K = 10

I am an algorithm for counting from K to 2^K. I do not work. I return: 1,-25,534, 15, 2^10. 
You check the last value, and conclude I counted correctly from k to 2^K.


[2024-10-08 6:08 PM] christopher5825
If you are relying on the assumption that you count correctly, that needs to be verified in the output. this is claiming that P!=NP if you use a very inefficient algorithm to compute 2^K and verify it with a good algorithm.


[2024-10-08 9:07 PM] calebnwokocha
@jacob "first year" janzen @Atish (Is NOT an Owl) @hawkstopher tuaheuer 

Suppose I have two jars A and B. Jar A volume is 1 unit and jar B volume is 2^k units. 

My problem is to fill jar B with water by using only jar A. Time complexity of this problem is O(2^k) because each loop of filling jar B requires O(1) and 1 unit of jar A. 

To verify whether the problem is indeed solved correctly, the verifier only have to check the brim of jar B and see that it is filled or not filled. The verification is constant time in nature, making the problem in NP. That is, solution of the problem requires exponential time and verification of the solution requires polynomial time. 

Is there an efficient polynomial time algorithm to solve the problem?


[2024-10-08 9:12 PM] jjanzenn
how do you verify that jar B was only filled using jar A?


[2024-10-08 9:14 PM] jjanzenn
say I have jar C of size 2^{k-1} units. I fill jar B by pouring the contents of jar C into jar B twice. The brim of jar B shows that it is filled yet jar B was not filled by only using jar A.


[2024-10-08 9:16 PM] jjanzenn
and again, this argument is no different, it is simply framed in a way that better obscures the obvious flaws in the proof


[2024-10-08 9:28 PM] calebnwokocha
The only way I think the verifier can verify that jar B was only filled using jar A is if the verifier was watching me as I solve the problem.


[2024-10-08 9:28 PM] slabdrill
generating a list of size 2^n isn't doable in polynomial time, although the argument is entirely different than what you seem to think it is. but what you're doing also isn't in NP.


[2024-10-08 9:29 PM] jjanzenn
An even better way to think about this is to consider the other (equivalent) definition of NP. That is, there must be a non-deterministic Turing machine that decides the problem in polynomial time. To print 2^k-k values with a nondeterministic Turing machine, you still need at least 2^k-k operations to print each value. The non-determinism changes nothing in this scenario. It can choose multiple state transitions at the same time, but at the end, each path of computation is independent and each path that halts in an accept state must have printed 2^k-k values independently in at least 2^k-k steps


[2024-10-08 9:29 PM] jjanzenn

[2024-10-08 9:37 PM] mythic7777
For you to show it is in NP-Compleye you need to show that you can verify it in non deterministic polynomial time and then further you need to show a valid polynomial reduction from a known NP-Cololete problem to your problem

Proof: (All integers are equal)
Let 𝑎 and 𝑏 be any two integers. We will prove that 𝑎=𝑏.

Consider the following equation:
𝑓(𝑥)=(𝑥−𝑎)(𝑥−𝑏)
This is a quadratic function. Now, let's expand it:
𝑓(𝑥)=𝑥^2−(𝑎+𝑏)𝑥+𝑎𝑏
Assume 𝑎=𝑏. In this case, the function simplifies:
𝑓(𝑥)=(𝑥−𝑎)^2=𝑥^2−2𝑎𝑥+𝑎^2

Clearly, the function has a double root at 
𝑥=𝑎.

Take the derivative of the function 𝑓(𝑥)
𝑓′(𝑥)=2𝑥−(𝑎+𝑏)
Now, evaluate the derivative at 
𝑥=𝑎 and 
𝑥=𝑏:

𝑓′(𝑎)=2𝑎−(𝑎+𝑏)=𝑎−𝑏
𝑓′(𝑏)=2𝑏−(𝑎+𝑏)=𝑏−𝑎

If 𝑎=𝑏, we have 𝑓′(𝑎)=𝑓′(𝑏)=0. This implies that the function’s slope is zero at both 
𝑎 and 𝑏.

Now suppose 
𝑎≠𝑏, but since 
𝑓′(𝑎)=𝑎−𝑏 and 
𝑓′(𝑏)=𝑏−𝑎, we get 
𝑎−𝑏=0, which means 
𝑎=𝑏.

Conclusion: Since we assumed nothing special about 
𝑎 and 𝑏, it follows that for any two integers 
𝑎 and 𝑏, 𝑎=𝑏. Therefore, all integers are equal.

### Theorem:  
All integers are equal.

### Proof:  

1. **Let \( a \) and \( b \) be any two integers**. We will prove that \( a = b \).

2. **Consider the following equation**:
   \[
   f(x) = (x - a)(x - b)
   \]
   This is a quadratic function. Now, let's expand it:
   \[
   f(x) = x^2 - (a + b)x + ab
   \]
   
3. **Assume \( a = b \)**. In this case, the function simplifies:
   \[
   f(x) = (x - a)^2 = x^2 - 2ax + a^2
   \]
   Clearly, the function has a double root at \( x = a \).

4. **Take the derivative of the function** \( f(x) \):
   \[
   f'(x) = 2x - (a + b)
   \]

5. **Now, evaluate the derivative at \( x = a \) and \( x = b \)**:
   \[
   f'(a) = 2a - (a + b) = a - b
   \]
   \[
   f'(b) = 2b - (a + b) = b - a
   \]

6. 
   If \( a = b \), we have \( f'(a) = f'(b) = 0 \). This implies that the function’s slope is zero at both \( a \) and \( b \).  
   
   **Now suppose \( a \neq b \)**, but since \( f'(a) = a - b \) and \( f'(b) = b - a \), we get \( a - b = 0 \), which means \( a = b \).

7. **Conclusion**: Since we assumed nothing special about \( a \) and \( b \), it follows that for any two integers \( a \) and \( b \), \( a = b \). Therefore, **all integers are equal**.

\[
\boxed{\text{Q.E.D.}}
\]

using the 'change' of a function to dictate how to increment (aka, on y=x^2, let x = 2, derivative is positive, and we're looking for a minima, so lets go  in the -x direction some distance and check the derivative there, repeat until derivative approx 0)


[2024-10-08 9:41 PM] slabdrill
gradient descent is an algorithm to try to find a maximum of some function. you make a guess arbitrarily and then pick a nearby point (based on the derivative of the function) in hopes that this new guess will be better
eventually you'll stop moving although you're still not necessarily at the maximum

is ML its own course


[2024-10-08 9:44 PM] mythic7777
Yeah


[2024-10-08 9:44 PM] headlesssteel
ok


[2024-10-08 9:45 PM] mythic7777
A 4th CS course


[2024-10-08 9:45 PM] headlesssteel
will I take that eventually then going for bsc comp sci


[2024-10-08 9:45 PM] mythic7777
It’s not a required course


[2024-10-08 9:45 PM] headlesssteel
ok


[2024-10-08 9:45 PM] mythic7777

the cs major works by giving you options for what 3rd/4th year classes you want to take for the most part, so if you want to take it you can but if you want something else instead then you won't


[2024-10-08 9:46 PM] mythic7777
ML is pretty theoretical so make sure you sharpen your fundamentals in math though


[2024-10-08 9:46 PM] mikey_9354
dont you dare make me rewatch it again this year


[2024-10-08 9:46 PM] mythic7777
Also I think you need Calc 3 to take it


[2024-10-08 9:46 PM] mythic7777
Lemme confirm


[2024-10-08 9:46 PM] kerchup
I think it’s just recommended


[2024-10-08 9:47 PM] headlesssteel
im stopping at calc 2 lol


[2024-10-08 9:47 PM] pieberrykinnie
only one way to confirm the hypothesis

[2024-10-08 9:49 PM] mythic7777
Okay so it’s either MATH 1300 coupled with MATH 1500 or Calc 3


[2024-10-08 9:49 PM] mythic7777
For ML


[2024-10-08 9:49 PM] mythic7777
Though it is recommended that you take Calc 3


[2024-10-08 9:49 PM] pieberrykinnie
not feeling youre falling behind is good mentality


[2024-10-08 9:49 PM] mythic7777
But I doubt you’ll be dealing with the hard parts of calc 3. Most likely you’ll just be doing Partial Derivatives


[2024-10-08 9:50 PM] headlesssteel
But I just meant, if you are already keeping up, and you have a few days where you dont have any homework, should you do extra study just because

you don't need to study if you're doing fine without it
how do you know if you're doing fine? you should be able to tell the moment you look at an assignment/test tbh

[2024-10-08 9:53 PM] kerchup
Depends on the course imo, if it’s a course where you’re building skills you don’t already have (most math courses, comp sci if you’re new to it) then regular practice is a good idea. Midterms usually don’t give you a lot of time per question, so being familiar enough that you can do it without thinking pays off


[2024-10-08 9:54 PM] headlesssteel

I looked online and other than a couple of math exchange links where they said that the closed form solution is hard to find; I found nothing.


[2024-10-08 10:00 PM] mythic7777
Also, is there a term for recurrence relations that rely on each other?


[2024-10-08 10:01 PM] mythic7777
For example if I have the same example as the fibonnacci sequences (Fn) and the exponential fibonacci sequence (Pn). Derive another recurrence relation Qn = F{n-1} + (P{n -2})^2.


[2024-10-08 10:01 PM] mythic7777
Is there a methodical way to solve such related recurrence relations?


[2024-10-08 10:02 PM] mythic7777
For linear terms, I can just apply the method of characteristic polynomials and solve for them, but it doesn't extend or generalize to higher order terms so I can't use that.


[2024-10-08 10:02 PM] slabdrill
i don't think there is a good way to find a closed-form solution in these cases, though i'd have to look more into it


[2024-10-08 10:02 PM] mythic7777
I'm gonna cry if there isn't.


[2024-10-08 10:03 PM] slabdrill
also (afaik) if you have recurrance relations that rely on each other then you can always rewrite it as a single complicated recurrance relation


[2024-10-08 10:04 PM] mythic7777
Yeah, that is true. The reason why I made the relation is because it has a geometric meaning with the question I'm trying to solve so it's easier to remember the relation.


[2024-10-09 12:43 AM] christopher5825
once again, as stated by your algorithm. The process is to entirely fill the jar b ONLY with jar a. This does not mean only verifying its full. This means verifying that the jar was filled ONLY by water from jar a. this can only be done by watching each pour. This is not a time when induction counts. If you wanted to try to do that, you would need a TM for the problem that accepts the final output, AND the TM used to produce the output. We know from theory class how that goes.


[2024-10-09 12:46 AM] christopher5825
imagine you look away and i fill it with pickle juice. it is full. it is now a pickle jar. this proof does not work


[2024-10-09 12:48 AM] christopher5825
that being said, if you have some way to verify in polynomial time that nothing else could have filled the jar, then you are cooking, but there isnt


[2024-10-09 12:48 AM] christopher5825
and this still really isn't a decision problem


[2024-10-09 10:35 AM] calebnwokocha
What if we remove the condition that jar B is filled by using only jar A. The new is problem is just fill jar B. Then the verifier don't need to check whether jar B was filled by using only jar A.


[2024-10-09 10:42 AM] jjanzenn
There is now a polynomial time algorithm: fill jar B with jar C which is of size 2^k units


[2024-10-09 10:44 AM] calebnwokocha
If filling jar C takes O(2^k) time, then filling jar B will take O(2^k).


[2024-10-09 10:49 AM] jjanzenn
Ok sure. We can treat it as a physical system. Now verify that there is water beneath the brim without checking each 2^k-1 unit beneath the top.


[2024-10-09 10:53 AM] calebnwokocha
It should be polynomial (constant) time verification.


[2024-10-09 10:54 AM] jjanzenn
Now verify that there is water beneath the brim without checking each 2^k-1 unit beneath the top.


[2024-10-09 11:00 AM] calebnwokocha
Jar B might not be filled entirely with water. As @hawkstopher tuaheuer pointed, a portion of Jar B may be filled with pickle juice. So the verification just at the brim won't work if Jar B contains pickle juice. To fix this, remove the condition that Jar B should only be filled with water. The new problem is just fill Jar B to its brim.


[2024-10-09 11:02 AM] jjanzenn
I place a layer of helium at the top of the jar. It floats on top of the air already in it. There is a fluid at the brim so the verification passes


[2024-10-09 11:06 AM] christopher5825
What you are asking is the same as ‘What is 2^K’. if your answer is binary you can even just shift K-1 times to do this.  for the jar scenario I just use a bigger jar to fill it.


[2024-10-09 11:08 AM] christopher5825
the orocess has now removed the limitation on how it’s filled. Instead of asking, print numbers from K to 2^K you are asking, what is 2^K. This is polynomial time.


[2024-10-09 11:08 AM] calebnwokocha
Let jar B be a transparent glass so that the verifier can see all its content in constant time.


[2024-10-09 11:09 AM] christopher5825
once again. what you are asking is, what is 2^K


[2024-10-09 11:17 AM] christopher5825
Filling Jar B in polynomial time. 
cur_k = K. 
helpers = [ jacob ]
While cur_k > 0: 
- each helper instantly recruits 1 new helper
- cur_k -= 1
Each helper, in parallel, dumps one unit of water into B.


[2024-10-09 11:19 AM] christopher5825
this is normally just called bit shifting though


[2024-10-09 11:25 AM] stegosnoreus
Yeah but @hawkstopher tuaheuer the jar is clear so you can just look inside.


[2024-10-09 11:26 AM] stegosnoreus
Use your peepers


[2024-10-09 11:36 AM] calebnwokocha
What is the time complexity of recruiting a new helper?


[2024-10-09 11:37 AM] jjanzenn
constant


[2024-10-09 11:41 AM] calebnwokocha
Recruitment is a long process that might require interview.


[2024-10-09 11:42 AM] jjanzenn
ok you're just being intentionally obtuse now.


[2024-10-09 11:45 AM] stegosnoreus
Caleb you should recognize the value that people have given by taking time to review your work. Peer review is part of the academic cycle and an important one at that.


[2024-10-09 11:48 AM] calebnwokocha
Very right Mark. I am just sharing my thoughts and appreciating any feedback on them.

Does a job interview time scale with the size of the jar?


[2024-10-09 12:48 PM] christopher5825
If you interview with a company, will the interview take longer if a jar is bigger somewhere in the world

the jar is a bad analogy for your proposed algorithm. why are you talking about a jar

if a job interview length does not scale with the SIZE OF A JAR, then it is called constant time
